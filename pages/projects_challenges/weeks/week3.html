        <br>
        <div class="css container" <h3>CSS Flexbox and Alignment</h3>
            <p>
                In Week 3, we continued our journey with CSS, focusing on mastering the Flexbox layout model and
                understanding the nuances of CSS alignment properties. Here are the key topics we covered:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexbox:</strong> Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout method
                    for
                    laying out items in rows or columns. We learned how to create flexible and responsive web layouts
                    using
                    the flex container and flex items.</li>
                <li><strong>Flex Container:</strong> Discussed the properties of the flex container such as
                    <code>display: flex</code>,
                    <code>flex-direction</code>,
                    <code>flex-wrap</code>, and
                    <code>justify-content</code> which define how flex items are laid out in the flex container.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Flex Items:</strong> Explored flex item properties including <code>flex-grow</code>,
                    <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code> to control the sizing and ordering of items
                    within
                    a flex container.
                </li>
                <li><strong>CSS Alignment:</strong> Learned about various CSS properties used for aligning elements,
                    such as
                    <code>align-items</code>, <code>align-self</code>, and <code>align-content</code>, crucial for
                    precise
                    positioning within flex containers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Applied Flexbox in practical scenarios to create responsive web
                    designs that adapt to different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-world Projects:</strong> Implemented Flexbox in several mini-projects, understanding
                    its
                    importance in modern web development and its role in creating fluid, scalable layouts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The knowledge gained this week has been pivotal in understanding the layout challenges and how Flexbox
                provides elegant solutions, making web design more efficient and visually appealing
            </p>

        <div class="Relation Databases" <h3>Relational Databases</h3>
            <p>
            <h4>Data inconsistency</h4>
            <p>Where the same data exists in more than one
                place, and the data is not in the same state, i.e.
                different data formats, or has been changed sol
                they no longer match.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Data redundancy</h4>
            <p>Where the same data exists in more than one
            <h4>foreign key</h4>
            <p>A foreign key is a field/column (or combination of
                field/columns) that is used to establish and
                enforce a link between the data in two tables to
                control the data that can be stored in the foreign
                key table.</p>
            <h4> Advantages</h4>
            <p>Relational databases are easier to manage and
                maintain. They are also more flexible and scalable.</p>

            <p>Flexibility. It's easy to add, update, or delete tables,
                relationships, and make other changes to data whenever you
                need without changing the overall database structure or
                impacting existing applications.</p>

            Accurate. You are less likely to have redundant or inconsistent
            data.

            Security. Because data is broken into entities, you can make
            some entities read only, or even deny access to some users.

            <h4> types of relationship databases</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>one-to-one</li>
                <li>one-to-zero or zero-to-one</li>
                <li>one-to-many</li>
                <li>many-to-one</li>
                <li>many-to-many</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>one-to-one</h5>
            <p>One to One
                Tables are related in such a way that one record
                in a table relates to only one record in a second
                table.</p>
            <h5></h5>
            <p>Tables are related in such a way that one record
                in a table relates to only one or more records in
                another table.</p>
            <h5>many-to-many</h5>
            <p>Tables are related in such a way that multiple
                records in a table relate to multiple records in
                another table.</p>

            <h5>problems with many to many</h5>
            <p>Many-to-many relationships can be difficult to
                manage because the database can't directly
                reference the relationship. Instead, the
                database must use an intermediary table to
                reference the two other tables. This
                intermediary table is called a junction table.
                The junction table contains the primary keys
                of both tables and creates a many-to-one
                relationship between the junction table and
                each of the other two tables.</p>
            <h6> example</h6>
            <p> - Customers Orders Products
                - A customer might make many orders
                - An order belongs to one customer An order contains many products
                - A product might be part of many orders

                this makes another many to many relationship to fix bind this
                - A customer might make many orders
                An order belongs to one customer An order contains many Items
                Each item is part of one order Each order item contains one product
                Each product may be many order items</p>
            <code>customer=>order=>Order_item=></code>

            <h5>Normalisation</h5>
            <p>A process to help you decide how and where to
                split a database into more tables and why.</p>
                <h5First Normal Form - 1NF</h5>
                    <p> For a table to be in the first normal form, it must meet
                        the following criteria:
                        
                        • a single cell must not hold more than one
                        value atomicity)
                        • there must be a primary key for identification
                        • There must be no duplicated rows or columns
                        • each column must have only one value for each row
                        in the table
                        • Each row must be unique
                        
                        <table id="1NF">
                            <tr>
                                <th>studentID</th>
                                <th>studentName</th>
                                <th>feesPaid</th>
                                <th>Dob</th>
        
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>1</td>
                                <td>John smith</td>
                                <td>18-jul-21</td>
                                <td>04-aug-2001</td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                <h5> Second Normal Form - 2NF</h5>

                The 1NF only eliminates repeating groups, not
                redundancy. That's why there is 2NF.

                A table is said to be in 2NF if it meets the following
                criteria:

                • It's already in 1NF
                • It has no partial dependency.
                That is, all non-key attributes are fully
                dependent on a primary key.
                <h5>1NF to 2NF</h5>
                <img src="assets/CleanShot 2024-01-23 at 10.43.47.png"alt="1NF to 2NF" >
                <p>The primary key is student ID, which
                represents the student. Let's look at each column:

                student name: Yes, this is dependent on the primary key. A different student ID means a different
                student name.
                fees paid: Yes, this is dependent on the primary key. Each fees paid value is for a single student.
                date of birth: Yes, it's specific to that student.
                address: Yes, it's specific to that student.
                subject 1: No, this column is not dependent on the student. More than one student can be enrolled in
                one subject.
                subject 2: As above, more than one subject is allowed.
                subject 3: No, same rule as subject 2.
                subject 4: No, same rule as subject 2
                teacher name: No, the teacher name is not dependent on the student.
                teacher address: No, the teacher address is not dependent on the student.
                course name: No, the course name is not dependent on the student.
                Room: No, the room is not dependant on the student.

                We have a mix of Yes and No here. Some fields are dependent on the student ID, and others are not.
                How can we resolve those we marked as No?</p>


                <h5>Third Normal Form - 3NF</h5>
                <p> Third normal form is the final stage of the most common
                    normalization process. The rule for this is:

                    Fulfils the requirements of 2NF
                    Has no transitive functional dependency

                    What does this even mean? What is a transitive functional
                    dependency?
                    It means that every attribute that is not the primary key
                    must depend on the primary key and the primary key
                    comanly.</p>

                • No duplicate rows or columns
                
                2NF
                • It's already in 1NF
                • All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
                
                3NF
                • Fulfils the requirements of 2NF
                • All attributes are dependant on the primary key, and no other
                fields at all
